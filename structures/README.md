# structures-tools
Simple tools for fire structural engineering, which makes the design process easier.

Most of them are intended to be used with SAFIR速 - fire structural code by University of Liege, Belgium.
Those scripts are not a part of the software. Nevertheless, some can be used generally to structural fire modelling.

* `safir_tools.py` - pre- and postprocessing of SAFIR速 simulations

* `get_in.py` - picking files with given extension (IN by default) from GiD catalogues and putting them into one directory

* `section_temp.py` - calculating mean temperature from TEM results

* `area2lineload.py` - changing area load to distributed beam load

* `iso2nf.py` - converting ISO heating to natural fire (LOCAFI, HASEMI, CFD), running natural fire simulations for BEAM and SHELL elements

* `uneven_loads.py` - assigning uneven loads to SHELL elements

* `manycfds.py` - calculating thermal response with more than one CFD transfer file

* `part_radf.py` - adjusting FDS transfer files (&RADF product) if FDS calculation has been stopped before T_RADF_END

* `alotofloacfis.py` - adjusting ignition times of multiple localized fires to tend to given summary HRR curve

* `eliminate.py` - replacing BEAM element to non-loadbearing using INSULATION material

* `ast2in.py` - handling transfer of thermal attack data from FDS adiabatic surface temperature devices to SAFIR速

Full documentation will be available soon...
